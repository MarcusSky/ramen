Vc pode voltar as features?",

I'm also doing the following:\r\n- Removing a few unused actions (issue created, issue assigned)\r\n- Using `Slack.Web.Chat` instead of the RTM version\r\n- Sending an empty string `text`, using `pretext` inside `attachments` \r\n\r\n### What's the motivation behind it?\r\n\r\n- Progressing with the features;\r\n- The removal of unused actions not to clutter the code;\r\n- The RTM version of the message sender does not allow for complex messages to be sent, only plaintext ones, so I had to switch to the Web version.\r\n- Slack prettifies a URL if it sees one on the `text` portion of the message and this would happen:\r\n![screen shot 2018-07-03 at 10 00 43](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2236125/42221296-fe0d2f1e-7ea7-11e8-8dac-253110ea4e47.png)\r\nI'm bypassing that by not sending an empty string on `text` and using `pretext`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2018-07-02 at 22 29 39](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2236125/42193861-8c5b70f2-7e47-11e8-9ea5-f26dfbaa9720.png)",
